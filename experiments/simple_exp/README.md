# Plan
* make images clickable
	* fix formatting of the display
	* images or locations should be clickable?
	* fix log_responses to save the location and stimuli info
* make it an incremental decision task
	* how much to reveal with every click?
	* how to slice the instruction
	* save every click in same instance with diff variable
* incorporating eyetracking stuff
	* how did Sun and Brehnny look at eye tracking data
	* talk to Daisy about how it gets saved/with clicks or a sep file
* clean stimuli list, replace space with underscore
